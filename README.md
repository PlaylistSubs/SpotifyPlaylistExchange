This app is meant to help unknown indie musicians to grow

INTRO

Hi! I'd need to develop an app and I have no idea if it's even possible to create, how difficult it might be and... Well... I just don't know a thing about coding and developing, so I figured to try to reach you, guys. Hopefully, you'd be able to give me some directions! :-)

APP OVERVIEW
.
The app would offer the users specific Spotify playlist in fixed order, one by one. After the users listened to one playlist (for at least 2 hours or 50 songs), the app would offer them the next one in queue. The users themselves would be able to add their own playlist to the app (via Spotify link) while they would be receiving "points" for every other playlist they've listened to. The order of playlists would be determined by the very points and would be updated on a weekly basis (mean. the user who gathered most points for listening other's playlists last week will have his/her own playlist on the first place in queue the following week).

CONTEXT:
I'm an indie playlist curator - I seek and share/promote music from artists who have just a very few fans and listeners but "radio-ready" songs. Such artists often have no money to spare on promotion of their songs and without that (or huge amount of luck), it's basically impossible to significantly grow your online fanbase, even if you're damn good.

Among indie artists, it's fairly common to be a part of so-called "stream-4-stream" playlists in an attempt to get more listeners and streams. Curators of such playlist will accept every song but they only keep it the playlist if artists stream the playlist several times a week. Not only that such approach is on the very edge of following Spotify's TOS, but it seriously harms artist's algorithms and actually lowers their chances to find new fans outside this "stream-4-stream" playlist.

In response to these practices, I established where we listen to each other's playlists, not just one playlist with everyone's song in it, over and over again. Such approach is perfectly ok with Spotify's TOS, it doesn't harm the algorithms and is beneficial not only for the members themselves, but also for all the other artists that are featured in our playlists.

We grow steadily but slowly, mostly because the "system" isn't very user friendly. We just have a roster of playlists written down and every time we listen to one, we then share a "proof of streaming" (screenshot of our recent listening history) to keep scammers away. Such system is just too outdated, too "I actually have to do it myself?!", to attract more members, while the very idea is embraced by nearly every indie musician and curator I approached.

NOTES
- I use the word "app", but it could be anything else - an extension, a website, a Discord server... I just don't know what's easier to make and what would work the best.



Thank you in advance! I'll be extremely happy for ANY suggestions, directions, ideas and feedback :-)
